Project Overview
Description
This project is a Django-based web application that utilizes Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building RESTful APIs. 
The primary focus is on user authentication and authorization using Simple JWT.

Authentication Flow
The authentication flow involves obtaining JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users. Here are the key steps:

    Registration (Optional):
    Users can register by providing necessary information.
    
    Login:
    Users authenticate by providing valid credentials (email and password).
    The server responds with a JWT Token, which the client stores.
    Access Restricted Endpoints:

    Include the JWT in the Authorization header for requests to secured endpoints.
    The server validates the token, granting or denying access accordingly.

settings.py:

Configure Django settings,  Simple JWT settings.
